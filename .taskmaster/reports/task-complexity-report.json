			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Create MyLearningPage Component",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the 'Create MyLearningPage Component' task into subtasks covering UI layout development, data fetching implementation, sorting/filtering functionality, and pagination. For each subtask, include specific UI requirements, data structures, and user interaction specifications.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating a data-rich UI component with multiple features like sorting, filtering, and pagination. While the functionality is well-defined, implementing a responsive and performant dashboard with good UX requires careful planning and implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Course Access Control",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Course Access Control' task into subtasks covering enrollment verification middleware, API endpoint development, client-side access control, and caching implementation. Include security requirements and testing scenarios for each subtask.",
			"reasoning": "Access control is a critical security feature that spans both backend and frontend. This task requires careful implementation to ensure content is properly restricted while maintaining good performance through caching. The security implications make this a higher complexity task."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Develop CourseContentPlayer Component with Mux Integration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the 'Develop CourseContentPlayer Component with Mux Integration' task into subtasks covering Mux setup, player component development, secure content delivery, and progress tracking integration. Include technical requirements and testing scenarios for each subtask.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating a third-party video platform with secure content delivery adds significant complexity. The component must handle various playback states, quality options, and accessibility requirements while ensuring videos are securely delivered only to authorized users."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Course Navigation and Section Progression",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Course Navigation and Section Progression' task into subtasks covering navigation component development, progression logic implementation, API integration, and state persistence. Include UI requirements and user flow specifications for each subtask.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating an interactive navigation system with state management across course sections. The complexity comes from managing user progression state and providing intuitive navigation while synchronizing with backend data."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Progress Tracking System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the 'Implement Progress Tracking System' task into subtasks covering progress calculation service, UI indicator components, progress update triggers, data synchronization, and milestone features.
