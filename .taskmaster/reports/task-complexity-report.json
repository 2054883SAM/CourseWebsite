			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository and Core Stack",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Setup Project Repository and Core Stack' task into subtasks covering: 1) Next.js project initialization with TypeScript, 2) Tailwind CSS and React-Bits integration, 3) Linting and formatting setup, 4) CI/CD pipeline configuration, and 5) Supabase project initialization.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple technologies (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, React-Bits, Supabase) and requires configuration of development environment, which adds moderate complexity. It's foundational for the project but follows established patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core Layout and Navigation",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Core Layout and Navigation' task into subtasks covering: 1) Responsive layout structure with Tailwind CSS, 2) Navigation bar implementation, 3) Footer and main content area development, and 4) Accessibility testing and improvements.",
			"reasoning": "This task focuses on frontend implementation with established technologies. While it requires attention to responsiveness and accessibility, the scope is well-defined and uses familiar patterns with Tailwind and React-Bits."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Build Course Catalog and Detail Pages",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Build Course Catalog and Detail Pages' task into subtasks covering: 1) Course catalog page with grid/list views, 2) Course detail page with section breakdowns, 3) Search functionality implementation, 4) Filter components and logic, and 5) Supabase data fetching integration.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves both UI development and data integration with Supabase. The search and filter functionality adds complexity, as does the need to design and implement two different page types with various interactive elements."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Basic Video Player Component",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Develop Basic Video Player Component' task into subtasks covering: 1) Mux Player integration, 2) Custom playback controls implementation, 3) Progress tracking and persistence, and 4) Responsive design and cross-device testing.",
			"reasoning": "Video player implementation has moderate complexity due to the need to integrate with Mux, implement custom controls, and ensure proper progress tracking. However, using an existing player library reduces some complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Authentication and Role-Based Access",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Integrate Authentication and Role-Based Access' task into subtasks covering: 1) NextAuth configuration with Supabase provider, 2) User role implementation (admin, creator, student), 3) Protected routes setup, 4) Profile management interface, and 5) Authentication state management.",
			"reasoning": "Authentication and role-based access control are inherently complex due to security implications. This task requires integration of NextAuth with Supabase, implementing different user roles, and ensuring proper access control throughout the application."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Build Course Management Interface",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Build Course Management Interface' task into subtasks covering: 1) Course creator dashboard UI, 2) Course creation form and workflow, 3) Section management interface, 4) Video upload component, 5) Course editing functionality, and 6) Data persistence with Supabase.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves building a complex dashboard with multiple CRUD operations, file uploads, and nested data structures. It requires careful state management and UX considerations for course creators."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Video Processing and Subtitle Support",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Video Processing and Subtitle Support' task into subtasks covering: 1) Mux API integration for video uploads, 2) Video processing workflow, 3) Subtitle file upload and management, 4) Language switching in video player, 5) DeepL integration for translation, and 6) Whisper integration for transcription.",
			"reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to integration with multiple external services (Mux, DeepL, Whisper), handling asynchronous video processing, and implementing subtitle support with language switching. It involves both frontend and backend work with complex workflows."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Payment Processing and Enrollment",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Integrate Payment Processing and Enrollment' task into subtasks covering: 1) Paddle API integration, 2) Purchase flow implementation, 3) Payment status tracking and webhooks, 4) Enrollment management system, and 5) Access control for paid content.",
			"reasoning": "Payment processing is inherently complex due to security requirements and the need to handle various edge cases. This task involves third-party integration with Paddle, implementing a robust purchase flow, and ensuring proper enrollment management."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement DRM Protection and Security Features",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement DRM Protection and Security Features' task into subtasks covering: 1) Mux DRM configuration and testing, 2) Supabase row-level security implementation, 3) API route security enhancements, and 4) Authentication flow security audit.",
			"reasoning": "Security and DRM implementation are highly complex due to the technical knowledge required and potential security implications. This task involves configuring DRM protection, implementing database-level security, and ensuring secure API routes and authentication."
