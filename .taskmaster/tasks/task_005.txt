# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Paddle Webhook Handler
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create webhook endpoint to process Paddle payment events, update enrollment records, and grant course access upon successful payment.
# Details:
1. Create `/api/webhooks/paddle` endpoint to receive Paddle webhooks
2. Implement webhook signature verification for security
3. Handle the following Paddle event types:
   - payment_succeeded: Create enrollment record with 'active' status
   - payment_refunded: Update enrollment status to 'refunded'
   - payment_disputed: Update enrollment status to 'disputed'
4. Create enrollment record in Supabase with user_id, course_id, and status
5. Implement idempotency to prevent duplicate processing
6. Add comprehensive error logging for webhook processing issues
7. Create admin notification for failed webhook processing

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for webhook signature verification
2. Mock webhook payloads for different event types
3. Integration tests with Supabase for enrollment record creation/updates
4. Test idempotency with duplicate webhook events
5. Verify proper error logging
6. End-to-end tests with Paddle sandbox webhooks
