# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Paddle V2 Checkout Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate Paddle V2 for secure payment processing, including API endpoint for creating checkout sessions and handling successful payments.
# Details:
1. Set up Paddle V2 account and configure API keys
2. Create `/api/checkout/:courseId` endpoint that:
   - Verifies user authentication

   - Returns checkout URL to client
3. Implement client-side redirect to Paddle hosted checkout
4. Handle success and cancel URLs for checkout completion
5. Store transaction IDs for verification
6. Implement error handling for failed checkout creation

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for checkout endpoint with mock Paddle API
2. Integration tests with Paddle sandbox environment
3. Test checkout flow with various course prices
4. Verify correct handling of success and cancel scenarios
5. Test error handling for API failures
6. End-to-end tests for complete checkout flow
