# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop EnrollButton Component
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a reusable EnrollButton component that handles the enrollment flow initiation, authentication checks, and redirects to Paddle checkout.
# Details:
1. Create EnrollButton React component with the following states:
   - Not enrolled (primary action)
   - Processing (disabled during checkout)
   - Enrolled (secondary indication)
2. Implement onClick handler that:
   - Verifies authentication status
   - Checks user role is 'student'
   - Calls the checkout API endpoint
   - Handles the redirect to Paddle checkout
3. Add loading states during API calls
4. Implement error handling for failed API calls
5. Add tooltip or modal for unauthenticated users explaining the need to log in

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for component rendering in different states
2. Integration tests for authentication verification
3. Mock API calls to test success/failure scenarios
4. User interaction tests for button clicks and state changes
5. Visual regression tests for different button states

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop EnrollButton UI Component [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the visual representation of the EnrollButton component with all required states and styling
### Details:
1. Create a React component with styled-components or CSS modules
2. Implement visual states for the button:
   - Not enrolled (primary action with 'Enroll Now' text)
   - Processing (loading spinner with 'Processing...' text)
   - Enrolled (secondary style with 'Enrolled' text)
3. Add hover and focus states for accessibility
4. Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop views
5. Add tooltip for additional information on hover
6. Ensure proper ARIA attributes for accessibility
7. Create storybook stories for each button state

The EnrollButton UI component has been successfully created and integrated into the CourseActions component in app/courses/[id]/components/CourseActions.tsx. 

Implementation details:
- Created component with all required visual states (Not enrolled, Processing, Enrolled)
- Added accessibility features including ARIA attributes, tooltips, and proper focus/hover states
- Implemented responsive design with full-width support
- Added contextual tooltips that change based on user authentication status
- Integrated into CourseActions component with enrollment status detection, processing state management, and disabled state handling
- Fully styled with Tailwind CSS following project design patterns

The component is now ready for authentication integration as the next step.

## 2. Implement Authentication Integration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add authentication verification logic to the EnrollButton component
### Details:
1. Create authentication check function that:
   - Verifies if user is logged in
   - Checks if user has 'student' role
   - Returns appropriate status and error messages
2. Implement modal or tooltip for unauthenticated users
3. Add redirect to login page for unauthenticated users
4. Create state management for authentication status
5. Handle error states for authentication failures
6. Add event handlers for authentication-related user actions
7. Implement unit tests for authentication verification logic
<info added on 2025-07-23T13:58:00.508Z>
Authentication integration has been successfully implemented for the EnrollButton component. The implementation includes:

1. Created an enrollment verification service in `lib/supabase/enrollments.ts` with:
   - Functions to check enrollment status for specific user/course combinations
   - A comprehensive `verifyEnrollmentEligibility` function that handles authentication, role checking, and enrollment status verification
   - Helper functions for retrieving user enrollments

2. Updated the CourseActions component to:
   - Use the enrollment verification service to check user eligibility
   - Properly handle different authentication states (not logged in, wrong role, already enrolled)
   - Display appropriate tooltip messages based on authentication status
   - Implement proper loading states during authentication checks
   - Handle authentication-related errors

3. Added comprehensive tests in `__tests__/components/courses/EnrollButtonAuthentication.test.tsx` that verify:
   - Authentication status checking
   - Role verification
   - Redirect to login for unauthenticated users
   - Proper handling of already enrolled users
   - Error handling for users without proper roles

This implementation completes the authentication integration subtask by ensuring the EnrollButton properly verifies user authentication status, checks for appropriate roles, and handles all authentication-related edge cases.

## 3. Develop API Integration and Checkout Flow [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Connect the EnrollButton to the checkout API and handle the Paddle integration
### Details:
1. Create API service function to call the checkout endpoint
2. Implement onClick handler that:
   - Triggers authentication check
   - Shows loading state during API call
   - Handles the redirect to Paddle checkout
3. Add error handling for API failures with user-friendly messages
4. Implement retry logic for failed API calls
5. Create success callback handling for completed enrollments
6. Add event tracking for analytics
7. Implement idempotency to prevent duplicate enrollments
8. Create comprehensive tests for API integration and error scenarios
<info added on 2025-07-23T14:17:42.805Z>
The API Integration and Checkout Flow for the EnrollButton component has been successfully implemented. The implementation includes:

1. **Created Checkout API Endpoint**:
   - Developed `/api/checkout/[courseId]/route.ts` to handle course enrollment requests
   - Implemented user authentication verification before checkout
   - Added role-based permission checks
   - Included verification for existing enrollments to prevent duplicates
   - Generated unique client reference IDs for idempotency
   - Structured the API response to provide necessary data for Paddle checkout

2. **Implemented Checkout Service**:
   - Created `lib/supabase/checkout.ts` with the `initiateCheckout` function to handle the checkout flow
   - Added error handling for all possible scenarios (API failures, already enrolled, etc.)
   - Implemented Paddle.js integration with proper loading checks
   - Created typed interfaces for consistent data handling
   - Added Promise-based handling of Paddle checkout callbacks

3. **Updated CourseActions Component**:
   - Integrated the checkout service with the EnrollButton
   - Implemented loading of Paddle.js during component initialization
   - Added error handling with user-friendly error messages
   - Updated UI to reflect checkout states (processing, success, error)
   - Added proper handling of "already enrolled" scenarios

4. **Created Comprehensive Tests**:
   - Added tests for the checkout integration in `__tests__/components/courses/EnrollButtonCheckout.test.tsx`
   - Created test cases for successful checkout flows
   - Added tests for error handling scenarios
   - Included tests for already enrolled cases
   - Implemented mocking of all dependencies for reliable testing
