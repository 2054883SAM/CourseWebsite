# Task ID: 1
# Title: Verify Database Schema and Access Policies
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure the existing Supabase database schema supports enrollment functionality and implement row-level security policies for proper access control.
# Details:
1. Verify the following tables exist in Supabase: enrollments, courses, sections, users
2. Ensure the enrollments table has fields for: user_id, course_id, status (active, refunded, disputed), created_at, updated_at
3. Implement row-level security (RLS) policies in Supabase:
   - Users can only view their own enrollment records
   - Users can only access course content they're enrolled in
   - Admins can view all enrollment records
4. Test RLS policies with different user roles
5. Document the database schema and RLS policies for team reference

# Test Strategy:
1. Write unit tests to verify database schema integrity
2. Create test cases for each RLS policy with different user roles (student, creator, admin)
3. Verify proper access control by attempting unauthorized access scenarios
4. Test query performance for enrollment lookups

# Subtasks:
## 1. Audit Database Schema Against Requirements [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review the current database schema to ensure it aligns with application requirements and security best practices.
### Details:
Acceptance Criteria:
- Complete inventory of all tables, views, and relationships
- Verification that all required fields exist with proper data types
- Identification of any missing indexes or constraints
- Schema normalization assessment

Technical Requirements:
- Use pg_dump or similar tool to extract current schema
- Compare against schema design documents
- Check for proper primary/foreign key relationships
- Verify appropriate use of NOT NULL constraints
- Document any schema changes needed

## 2. Implement Row-Level Security Policies [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Design and implement row-level security (RLS) policies to enforce proper data access controls at the database level.
### Details:
Acceptance Criteria:
- RLS policies implemented for all tables containing sensitive data
- Policies align with application's permission model
- Policies properly filter data based on user context
- No performance degradation beyond acceptable thresholds

Technical Requirements:
- Enable row_security on relevant tables
- Create appropriate policies using CREATE POLICY statements
- Implement using current_user or application-specific user context
- Document all policy definitions with explanations
- Include policy creation in database migration scripts

## 3. Test Database Access Controls [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Develop and execute comprehensive tests to verify that database access controls and RLS policies function correctly.
### Details:
Acceptance Criteria:
- Test coverage for all implemented RLS policies
- Verification that users can only access authorized data
- Confirmation that administrative functions work properly
- Performance testing under various access scenarios

Technical Requirements:
- Create test users with different permission levels
- Develop automated test scripts to verify access patterns
- Test both positive and negative cases (access granted/denied)
- Document test results with evidence of policy effectiveness
- Include edge cases such as null values and special permissions

## 4. Document Schema and Security Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for the database schema and security implementation for developers and administrators.
### Details:
Acceptance Criteria:
- Complete ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)
- Detailed documentation of all RLS policies
- Clear explanation of access control model
- Guidelines for developers on working with secured tables
- Maintenance procedures for security policies

Technical Requirements:
- Use tools like dbdiagram.io or similar for ERD creation
- Include SQL scripts for all policy implementations
- Document testing procedures for future validation
- Create developer guidelines for application integration
- Include troubleshooting section for common issues
