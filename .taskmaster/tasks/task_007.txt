# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Course Access Control
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the system to securely restrict course content to enrolled students and verify enrollment status before displaying content.
# Details:
1. Create enrollment verification middleware that:
   - Checks if user is authenticated
   - Verifies active enrollment for requested course
   - Returns appropriate error for unauthorized access
2. Implement `/api/courses/enrollment/:id` endpoint to check enrollment status
3. Create client-side access control in course content pages
4. Add redirect logic for unenrolled users attempting to access restricted content
5. Implement caching for frequent enrollment checks to improve performance
6. Create clear error messages for various access denial reasons

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for enrollment verification middleware
2. Integration tests with mock enrollment data
3. Test access control with various user scenarios (enrolled, not enrolled, refunded)
4. Verify proper error handling and messages
5. Performance testing for cached vs. uncached enrollment checks
6. Security testing to ensure content cannot be accessed without proper enrollment
