# Thumbnail Upload Issue - Complete Fix

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Deprecated Supabase Client**
**Problem**: The `create-video/page.tsx` was using the deprecated `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` package instead of the recommended `@supabase/ssr`.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated import from `createClientComponentClient` to `createBrowserClient`
- Updated client initialization to use environment variables directly

### 2. ✅ **Missing Storage Bucket and Policies** 
**Problem**: The `course-thumbnails` storage bucket didn't exist and had no Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added complete storage bucket creation and policies to `supabase-schema.sql`
- Created standalone SQL file `setup-course-thumbnails-bucket.sql` for easy deployment
- Policies ensure only `admin` and `creator` roles can upload thumbnails

### 3. ✅ **Missing Role Authorization**
**Problem**: No validation to ensure only authorized users (admins/creators) could access the course creation page.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added comprehensive authorization checks in the component
- Loading states for better UX
- Clear error messages for unauthorized access
- User role display for debugging

### 4. ✅ **React Hooks Violations**
**Problem**: React hooks were being called conditionally after early returns.

**Fix Applied**:
- Moved all hooks (useState, useRef) before any conditional returns
- Proper React hooks order maintained

### 5. ✅ **Missing Database Column**
**Problem**: The `chapters` JSONB column was missing from the main schema.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `chapters JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb` column to courses table

### 6. ✅ **Enhanced Error Handling**
**Problem**: Generic error messages made debugging difficult.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added detailed console logging for debugging
- File validation (type and size checks)
- Specific error messages with technical details

## Files Modified

1. **`app/create-video/page.tsx`**
   - Updated Supabase client to use `@supabase/ssr`
   - Added role-based authorization
   - Enhanced error handling and debugging
   - Fixed React hooks order

2. **`supabase-schema.sql`**
   - Added `chapters` column to courses table
   - Added complete storage bucket and policies for `course-thumbnails`

3. **`setup-course-thumbnails-bucket.sql`** (New file)
   - Standalone SQL script for setting up the thumbnail storage bucket
   - Can be run independently if needed

4. **`THUMBNAIL_UPLOAD_FIX_README.md`** (This file)
   - Complete documentation of the fixes

## Database Migration Required

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: You need to apply the database changes:

### Option 1: Full Schema Update
If this is a new database, run the updated `supabase-schema.sql`.

### Option 2: Incremental Update
If you have an existing database, run these commands in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Add chapters column if missing
ALTER TABLE courses 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS chapters JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb;

-- Create storage bucket and policies
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('course-thumbnails', 'course-thumbnails', true)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET public = true;

-- Ensure RLS is enabled
ALTER TABLE storage.objects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Add storage policies (drop existing ones first to avoid conflicts)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow creators and admins to upload course thumbnails" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read access to course thumbnails" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow creators and admins to update course thumbnails" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow creators and admins to delete course thumbnails" ON storage.objects;

CREATE POLICY "Allow creators and admins to upload course thumbnails" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'course-thumbnails' 
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM users 
    WHERE id = auth.uid() 
    AND role IN ('admin', 'creator')
  )
);

CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access to course thumbnails" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'course-thumbnails');

CREATE POLICY "Allow creators and admins to update course thumbnails" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE USING (
  bucket_id = 'course-thumbnails' 
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM users 
    WHERE id = auth.uid() 
    AND role IN ('admin', 'creator')
  )
) WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'course-thumbnails' 
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM users 
    WHERE id = auth.uid() 
    AND role IN ('admin', 'creator')
  )
);

CREATE POLICY "Allow creators and admins to delete course thumbnails" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE USING (
  bucket_id = 'course-thumbnails' 
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM users 
    WHERE id = auth.uid() 
    AND role IN ('admin', 'creator')
  )
);
```

## Testing Steps

1. **Verify Database Setup**:
   - Check that `course-thumbnails` bucket exists in Supabase Storage
   - Verify all policies are active
   - Confirm `chapters` column exists in `courses` table

2. **Test User Access**:
   - Login as a user with `student` role → Should see "Accès non autorisé"
   - Login as a user with `creator` or `admin` role → Should see the form

3. **Test Thumbnail Upload**:
   - Select an image file
   - Submit the form
   - Check browser console for detailed logs
   - Verify image appears in Supabase Storage bucket

4. **Debug if Issues Persist**:
   - Check browser console for detailed error messages
   - Verify user role in console logs
   - Check Supabase Storage policies in dashboard
   - Confirm environment variables are set correctly

## Expected Behavior

✅ **Before Fix**: Upload failed with generic "permission denied" errors  
✅ **After Fix**: Upload succeeds with detailed logging, or shows specific error messages for debugging

## Console Logging

The enhanced error handling now provides:
- File validation details
- User role and ID information  
- Upload path and progress
- Detailed error messages with technical information
- Success confirmations with generated URLs

This makes debugging much easier and provides clear feedback about what's happening during the upload process.
