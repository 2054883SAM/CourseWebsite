# Accessibility Report

## Overview

This document outlines the accessibility improvements made to the EzioAcademy platform to ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards. The improvements focus on keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, proper ARIA attributes, and visual contrast.

## Implemented Accessibility Features

### 1. Keyboard Navigation

- **Skip to Content Link**: Added a skip link that allows keyboard users to bypass navigation and jump directly to main content
- **Focus Management**: Implemented proper focus trapping in modals and dropdowns
- **Keyboard Controls**: Enhanced dropdown menus with arrow key navigation and Enter/Space selection
- **Focus Indicators**: Added visible focus styles for all interactive elements
- **Tabbing Order**: Ensured logical tab order throughout the application

### 2. ARIA Attributes and Roles

- **Landmark Roles**: Added appropriate landmark roles (banner, navigation, main, contentinfo)
- **ARIA Labels**: Implemented aria-label, aria-labelledby, and aria-describedby where needed
- **State Attributes**: Added aria-expanded, aria-haspopup, aria-controls for interactive components
- **Live Regions**: Implemented aria-live regions for dynamic content like form validation messages
- **Hidden Content**: Used aria-hidden for decorative elements and off-screen content

### 3. Screen Reader Compatibility

- **Alternative Text**: Added descriptive alt text for all images
- **Form Labels**: Ensured all form controls have proper labels
- **Semantic HTML**: Used semantic HTML elements (nav, main, footer, etc.) for better screen reader interpretation
- **Heading Structure**: Implemented proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6)
- **ARIA Roles**: Added appropriate ARIA roles to enhance screen reader navigation

### 4. Visual Design

- **Color Contrast**: Ensured text meets WCAG AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- **Focus Indicators**: Added visible focus styles that don't rely solely on color
- **Text Sizing**: Implemented relative units (rem/em) for text to support browser zoom
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured layouts adapt to different viewport sizes and zoom levels

## Component-Specific Improvements

### Header Component

- Added role="banner" to the header
- Implemented keyboard-accessible dropdown menus
- Added aria-expanded and aria-controls to mobile menu button
- Improved focus management in mobile menu
- Added aria-current for active navigation items

### Footer Component

- Added role="contentinfo" to the footer
- Implemented proper heading structure with aria-labelledby
- Added role="list" and aria-labelledby to navigation sections
- Improved keyboard accessibility for links
- Added proper aria-label for social media links

### Navigation Components

- Added role="navigation" and aria-label to nav elements
- Implemented ActiveLink component with proper aria-current
- Enhanced mobile menu with proper focus management
- Added descriptive aria-labels for icon-only buttons

### Form Components

- Added proper labels for all form controls
- Implemented aria-required and aria-invalid for form validation
- Added descriptive error messages with aria-live
- Improved focus management in form submission flows
- Added aria-describedby for form instructions

### Content Structure

- Implemented proper heading hierarchy
- Added id attributes for section landmarks
- Used semantic HTML elements throughout
- Implemented proper list structures with role="list"

## Testing Methodology

The accessibility improvements were tested using:

1. **Keyboard Navigation**: Manual testing of all interactive elements
2. **Screen Readers**: Testing with popular screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver)
3. **Automated Tools**: Lighthouse and axe accessibility audits
4. **Color Contrast**: Color contrast analyzer tools
5. **Responsive Testing**: Testing at various viewport sizes and zoom levels

## Ongoing Accessibility Maintenance

To maintain accessibility standards:

1. Include accessibility checks in code reviews
2. Run automated accessibility tests as part of CI/CD pipeline
3. Conduct periodic manual testing with assistive technologies
4. Keep accessibility documentation updated
5. Train new team members on accessibility best practices
