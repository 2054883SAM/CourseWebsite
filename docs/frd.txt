# Course Enrollment, Payment and Course Access

## Overview
This feature enables students to enroll in courses through secure online payments, access their purchased content through a personalized learning dashboard, and view course materials including video content. It forms the core business functionality of the platform, connecting the payment processing system with content access controls.

## Core Features

### Student Enrollment System
- Allows authenticated students to purchase and enroll in courses
- Uses Paddle V2 for one-time payments with hosted checkout
- Creates enrollment records upon successful payment
- Restricts enrollment to authenticated users with "student" role

### My Learning Dashboard
- Personalized dashboard showing all enrolled courses
- Direct access to course content from dashboard
- Progress tracking for enrolled courses
- Sorting and filtering options for multiple enrollments

### Course Content Access Control
- Securely restricts course content to enrolled students
- Section-by-section navigation of course materials
- Video playback for each section using Mux Player
- Progress tracking across course sections

## User Experience

### User Personas
- **Students**: Primary users who browse, purchase, and consume course content
- **Creators**: Course creators who provide the educational material
- **Admins**: Platform administrators who manage enrollments and access

### Key User Flows

#### Enrollment Flow
1. Student browses course catalog and views course details
2. Student clicks "Enroll" button on desired course
3. System verifies authentication status and role
4. Student completes payment through Paddle checkout
5. System records enrollment and grants access to course content
6. Student is redirected to course content or confirmation page

#### Course Access Flow
1. Student navigates to "My Learning" section
2. System displays all enrolled courses
3. Student selects desired course
4. System loads course sections and materials
5. Student navigates between sections, viewing video content
6. System tracks progress through sections and course completion

### UI/UX Considerations
- Enrollment button states reflect current status (not enrolled, processing, enrolled)
- Clear messaging for authentication/authorization requirements
- Intuitive navigation between enrolled courses and course sections
- Seamless video playback experience for course content
- Visual indicators for course progress and completion status

## Technical Architecture

### System Components
1. **EnrollButton Component**: Manages enrollment flow initiation
2. **MyLearningPage Component**: Displays enrolled courses
3. **CourseAccess Component**: Controls content access based on enrollment
4. **CourseContentPlayer Component**: Renders course section videos
5. **EnrollmentService**: Handles enrollment records and status checks

### Data Models
- Existing database schema in Supabase is sufficient
- Key tables: enrollments, courses, sections, users
- Enrollment status values: active, refunded, disputed
- Section records contain unique Mux playbackId for video content

### APIs and Integrations
1. **Supabase Integration**
   - Authentication and role verification
   - Enrollment record storage and querying
   - Row-level security for data access control

2. **Paddle V2 Integration**
   - Hosted checkout for one-time payments
   - Webhook handling for payment events
   - Transaction tracking and verification

3. **Mux Integration**
   - Video playback for course sections
   - Secure content delivery
   - Player configuration with section-specific playbackIds

### API Endpoints
1. **`POST /api/checkout/:courseId`**: Creates checkout session
2. **`GET /api/courses/enrollment/:id`**: Checks enrollment status
3. **`POST /api/webhooks/paddle`**: Handles payment webhooks

## Development Roadmap

### MVP Requirements
1. **Basic Enrollment System**
   - Authentication and role verification
   - Paddle checkout integration for one-time payments
   - Enrollment record creation upon successful payment
   - Basic access control for course content

2. **Essential Course Access**
   - My Learning page with enrolled courses listing
   - Course content page with section navigation
   - Basic video playback for course sections
   - Simple enrollment status checks

### Future Enhancements
1. **Advanced Enrollment Features**
   - Gifting courses to other users
   - Course bundles with discounted pricing
   - Subscription-based access options
   - Payment plan options for expensive courses

2. **Enhanced Learning Experience**
   - Detailed progress tracking and reporting
   - Bookmarking and notes within course content
   - Resume watching functionality
   - Course completion certificates

3. **Content Access Improvements**
   - Offline viewing options
   - Mobile-optimized video playback
   - Adaptive streaming based on connection quality
   - Enhanced subtitle and language support

## Logical Dependency Chain

### Foundation (Build First)
1. Database schema verification and access policies
2. Authentication and role-based access control integration
3. Basic enrollment service implementation

### Core Functionality
1. Paddle checkout integration for course purchases
2. Webhook handling for payment confirmation
3. Enrollment record creation and management
4. My Learning page implementation

### Enhanced Features
1. Course content access control implementation
2. Section-based video playback with Mux
3. Course navigation and section progression
4. Progress tracking across course sections

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Challenges
- **Risk**: Payment webhook failures could lead to access issues
  **Mitigation**: Implement robust error handling and manual override capabilities

- **Risk**: Video playback issues across different devices
  **Mitigation**: Extensive cross-device testing and progressive enhancement

### Integration Concerns
- **Risk**: Paddle API changes could break payment functionality
  **Mitigation**: Build abstraction layer between payment provider and application

- **Risk**: Mux video playback security vulnerabilities
  **Mitigation**: Implement proper authentication checks and signed URLs

### User Experience Risks
- **Risk**: Complex enrollment process decreasing conversion
  **Mitigation**: Streamline checkout flow, minimize steps, provide clear feedback

- **Risk**: Confusion about course access after purchase
  **Mitigation**: Clear post-purchase guidance and immediate access to content
